		 test of the series at sialkot,younis hit him on the nose with a bouncer.His nose was totally smashed out of place.The entire pakistan 
		 team gathered around him and javed mianded said your nose is broken.you have to leave right away to the hospital.But Sachin Tendulkar 
		 says,I’ll play and next ball he was good shot and four runs.He made 57 runs and saved the game for india was unbelievable.</p>
